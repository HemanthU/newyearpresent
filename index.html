            <p>
                This year didn’t begin with fireworks for me.
                It began with thoughts of you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Somewhere between ordinary days,
                you became the place where my heart rests.
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
                No matter what changes,
                one thing won’t —
                I’m here. Always.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Moni,

Before you read even one more line, I want you to pause. Not because this is heavy, but because you deserve gentleness. Sit comfortably. Breathe the way you do when you’re trying to calm your heart. This letter isn’t here to rush you. It’s here to stay with you — the way I wish I could stay beside you whenever your thoughts get loud.

I’ve always believed some feelings are too big for conversations. They need space. They need time. They need silence between words. That’s why I’m writing this instead of saying it out loud. Because when I speak, I sometimes miss things. When I write, my heart has time to catch up.

You didn’t arrive in my life with fireworks or announcements. You came quietly, naturally — and somehow that made it more powerful. At first, you were just a person. Then a thought. Then a habit. And before I realized it, you became a feeling my heart refused to let go of. Not suddenly. Gradually. Like rain soaking into the earth — unnoticed until everything is changed.

Moni, there’s something about you that feels deeply human. You don’t hide your emotions behind pride. You don’t pretend to be okay when you’re not — at least not for long. You feel joy loudly and pain honestly. And even though the world often teaches people to harden themselves, you stayed soft. That softness is not weakness. It’s courage.

I know you struggle sometimes. Not because you tell me, but because I can sense it in the way your mood shifts, the way your voice changes, the way you go quiet after being expressive. You carry a lot inside yourself. Thoughts you don’t always say. Fears you don’t always name. Feelings you sometimes wish you could turn off, just to rest.

You overthink because you care.
You get jealous because you love.
You get angry because you’re scared of losing.
You cry because you feel deeply.

None of those things make you difficult. They make you real.

There are moments when you’re angry, shouting, overwhelmed — and later you cry, exhausted by your own emotions. Those moments stay with me. Not because they scare me, but because they show me how much you feel, how much you give, how much your heart stretches for the people you love. I never see you as “too much.” I see you as someone who loves without limits in a world that often demands restraint.

I wish you could understand how safe you feel to me. Even when you’re upset. Even when you’re silent. Even when you’re not at your best. Your presence doesn’t demand perfection. It invites honesty. With you, I don’t feel like I have to perform or pretend. I can just be — and that is rare.

Sometimes I think about how you see yourself. I know you’re hard on yourself. You notice your flaws before your strengths. You replay moments, wondering if you said too much, felt too much, reacted too much. You question your worth in ways you’d never question anyone else’s. And every time you do that, I wish I could gently take those thoughts from you and replace them with truth.

So let me tell you the truth — slowly, clearly, without decoration:

You are enough on your quiet days.
You are enough on your loud days.
You are enough when you’re calm.
You are enough when you’re angry.
You are enough when you cry.
You are enough when you laugh.

You don’t need to earn love by shrinking yourself.

There are nights when you feel lonely even when you’re not alone. Nights when your chest feels heavy for no clear reason. Nights when memories, fears, and imaginary futures collide inside your head. I know those nights. I know how they make you curl inward, how tears come easily then. If I could be there every time, I’d sit beside you without asking questions. I’d let you cry without telling you to stop. I’d remind you that you’re allowed to feel exactly what you’re feeling.

You don’t need fixing, Moni.
You need understanding.

I love how protective you are of what you love. How fiercely you hold onto people who matter to you. How you get scared of losing because you invest your whole heart. That kind of attachment isn’t something everyone can offer. It’s precious. And anyone who receives it should treat it gently.

You have a way of staying with people — even after conversations end, even after days pass. Your presence lingers. Your words echo. Your emotions leave a mark. You don’t pass through lives unnoticed. You become part of them.

Sometimes you worry about being replaced. About someone else becoming more important. About being forgotten. And Moni, I need you to know this: people can come and go, but what you give cannot be replicated. The way you love is yours alone. It can’t be copied or replaced.

I don’t love you because things are always easy. I love you because you are honest. Because you don’t hide your heart. Because you let yourself feel even when it hurts. Because you choose connection over distance, vulnerability over numbness.

I want you in your entirety — not just the polished parts. I want the messy emotions, the sudden tears, the unexpected laughter, the stubborn anger, the soft apologies, the quiet moments where words fail. I want all of it because all of it is you.

If loving you means patience, I choose patience.
If loving you means reassurance, I choose reassurance.
If loving you means standing steady while emotions crash, I choose to stand.

You don’t have to be strong every day. You don’t have to hold yourself together all the time. You’re allowed to rest inside someone else’s care sometimes. You’re allowed to lean. You’re allowed to fall apart and be gathered again.

Moni, you are not a burden.
Your emotions are not a problem.
Your love is not excessive.

It is rare.

And if there ever comes a moment when you doubt yourself — when your mind tells you that you’re hard to love, hard to keep, hard to understand — I want you to remember this letter. Remember that someone sat down and poured their heart into words for you. Slowly. Carefully. Because you mattered enough to be written about this way.

No matter where life takes us, no matter how days change, there will always be a part of me that knows you as someone deeply meaningful. Someone who taught me what it looks like to feel without fear. Someone whose presence changed the shape of my heart.

You are loved in a way that doesn’t disappear with moods.
You are wanted in a way that doesn’t fade with time.
You are held — not tightly, not possessively — but gently, steadily, sincerely.

And if the world ever feels too loud, too harsh, too fast, I hope you remember that there is a place where you don’t have to prove anything. A place where your emotions are welcomed, not judged. A place where you are seen fully and still chosen.

That place is my heart.

I don’t know if you remember this day the way I do,
but I’ve been carrying it quietly in my heart all day.

Today, one year ago, something very small happened —
and somehow, everything changed.

We didn’t know it then.
There were no fireworks, no dramatic moments, no promises made out loud.
Just a normal day… and two people crossing paths.

But today, one year later, I realize something very clearly:
that day mattered more than I could ever explain.

I remember the way the day felt.
Not special — just real.
And maybe that’s why it stayed with me.

Last year, I met you without knowing that you would slowly become
someone my heart would recognize before my mind did.
I didn’t plan it.
I didn’t expect it.
I just… met you.

And now, here we are — one year later.

In this one year, nothing about life became perfect.
Days were still heavy sometimes.
Things were still confusing.
But somehow, your presence made things softer.

I don’t know exactly when it happened.
I can’t point to one moment and say “this is when I fell for you.”
It was quieter than that.

It was in the small things.

In the way I started looking forward to hearing from you.
In the way your name stopped being just a name.
In the way my mood could change just by knowing you were around.

You became a part of my days without asking for space —
and somehow, without taking too much either.

That’s rare.

If you’re reading this, I want you to do one thing before anything else — breathe. Slowly. Don’t rush. Don’t think about what’s next. Just stay here with me for a while. This letter isn’t meant to be skimmed or hurried. It’s meant to be felt, the way you feel everything — deeply, honestly, without filters.

There are so many things I’ve wanted to say to you but never found the perfect moment. Life keeps moving, days keep passing, and sometimes feelings get tucked away because words feel too small. So I’m writing now, letting my heart speak in the only way it knows — truthfully.

You came into my life and changed the rhythm of it without even trying. Before you, days were just days. After you, days started having meaning. Suddenly, time mattered differently. Suddenly, small things mattered — messages, silences, moods, the tone of your voice, the way you say my name. Everything became connected to you in ways I didn’t expect and couldn’t stop.

Moni, you are not ordinary. And I don’t mean that in a dramatic way — I mean it in the quietest, most real sense. You feel things at a depth most people are afraid of. You love with intensity. You get attached. You get jealous. You get angry. You cry. You care. And you do all of it without pretending you don’t. That kind of honesty is rare, and it’s beautiful, even when it hurts.

I know there are moments when you feel like you’re “too much.” Too emotional. Too sensitive. Too attached. Too expressive. But listen to me carefully — the world doesn’t break people like you because you’re weak. It breaks them because you’re open. Because you don’t numb yourself. Because you don’t shut down your heart just to survive.

You feel deeply because your heart is alive.

There are times when you cry so hard that even you don’t understand why. You cry until your chest feels heavy and your eyes burn and your tears won’t stop coming. And every time that happens, I wish I could take that pain from you and hold it myself. Not because I think you can’t handle it — but because you shouldn’t have to handle it alone.

You don’t always say it, but I know you feel scared sometimes. Scared of losing. Scared of not being enough. Scared of being replaced. Scared that people will leave once they see all of you — the emotional you, the angry you, the insecure you. And Moni, if I could carve one truth into your heart, it would be this:

I don’t love you despite those parts.
I love you including those parts.

Your jealousy doesn’t scare me — it tells me you care.
Your anger doesn’t push me away — it tells me you’re hurting.
Your tears don’t make you weak — they show me how deeply you feel.

I love how protective you are. How your heart guards what it loves. How you get upset not because you want control, but because you’re afraid of losing what matters to you. That fear comes from love, and love like that is not something to be ashamed of.

You have no idea how much comfort you give me just by existing. On days when my mind feels loud, thinking about you calms it. On days when things feel meaningless, you give them weight. Sometimes, just knowing you’re there — even without words — is enough to make me feel grounded.

There’s something about you that feels like home. Not a perfect home. Not a quiet home. But a real one. The kind where emotions are allowed. Where laughter and tears live in the same space. Where nothing is fake and nothing is hidden.

Moni, I don’t want a version of you that’s easier to love.
I don’t want you quieter, calmer, less emotional.
I don’t want you smaller.

I want you.

For me it has always been this 
                <p class="highlight">
DO THINGS FROM LOVE 
NOT FOR LOVE
            </p>
Everyday i do something for you its not only for you or me
  
<p class="highlight">
              ITS FOR US
            </p>            
                

I want you on the days you laugh endlessly and on the nights you cry without knowing why. I want you when you’re excited about small things and when you’re tired of everything. I want you when you’re confident and when you doubt yourself. I want you when you’re affectionate and when you need space but don’t know how to ask for it.

If loving you means holding space for your emotions, I’ll hold it.
If loving you means patience, I’ll learn it.
If loving you means reassurance again and again, I’ll give it — not because you’re needy, but because you deserve to feel safe.

I wish you could see yourself through my eyes, even for a moment. You’d see someone strong without trying to be. Someone soft in a hard world. Someone whose presence lingers even when they’re gone. Someone whose love leaves a mark.

You matter more than you think, Moni. Your feelings matter. Your voice matters. Your tears matter. You are not replaceable, forgettable, or invisible — no matter how your mind tries to convince you otherwise on difficult days.

If there ever comes a moment when you feel alone, misunderstood, or overwhelmed, remember this letter. Remember that there is someone who sees all of you and still chooses you. Someone who doesn’t expect you to be perfect, just real. Someone whose heart recognizes yours without effort.

I don’t promise perfection. I don’t promise that life will always be gentle. But I promise honesty. I promise presence. I promise that when you feel like you’re falling apart, you won’t be falling alone.

You are loved in ways you may never fully measure.
You are wanted in ways that don’t fade with moods or moments.
And you are held — quietly, steadily, deeply — in my heart.

No matter what tomorrow looks like, no matter how the world changes, a part of me will always know you as someone irreplaceable.

This year taught me something important:
real connections don’t arrive loudly.
They grow slowly, patiently, without demanding attention.

And you… you grew into my life like that.

Today, when I think about last year, I don’t think about how much has changed around us.
I think about how much has changed inside me.

I think about how you became someone I care about — deeply, genuinely, without conditions.

I think about how your happiness started mattering to me in a way I didn’t plan.

I think about how, even on days we didn’t talk much,
you still stayed somewhere in my thoughts.

That’s when I knew this wasn’t just a phase.
It wasn’t just a moment.

It was something real.

One year ago, we met.
And today, I’m grateful — not because everything is perfect,
but because something honest began.

I don’t know what the future looks like.
I won’t pretend I have answers.
But I know this:
meeting you was not a coincidence to my heart.

If I could go back to that day last year,
I wouldn’t change anything.

Not the timing.
Not the words.
Not even the silence.

Because every part of it led to this —
to me sitting here, writing to you, feeling thankful that our paths crossed.

Moni,
thank you for being exactly who you are.
Thank you for being gentle in ways you don’t even realize.
Thank you for being someone my heart feels safe choosing.

One year ago, we met.
And today, I can say this honestly —

No matter what tomorrow brings,
I’m glad it was you.
Hope you have a good day

Always.
