            <p>
                This year didn’t begin with fireworks for me.
                It began with thoughts of you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Somewhere between ordinary days,
                you became the place where my heart rests.
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
                No matter what changes,
                one thing won’t —
                I’m here. Always.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moni,

I don’t know if you remember this day the way I do,
but I’ve been carrying it quietly in my heart all day.

Today, one year ago, something very small happened —
and somehow, everything changed.

We didn’t know it then.
There were no fireworks, no dramatic moments, no promises made out loud.
Just a normal day… and two people crossing paths.

But today, one year later, I realize something very clearly:
that day mattered more than I could ever explain.

I remember the way the day felt.
Not special — just real.
And maybe that’s why it stayed with me.

Last year, I met you without knowing that you would slowly become
someone my heart would recognize before my mind did.
I didn’t plan it.
I didn’t expect it.
I just… met you.

And now, here we are — one year later.

In this one year, nothing about life became perfect.
Days were still heavy sometimes.
Things were still confusing.
But somehow, your presence made things softer.

I don’t know exactly when it happened.
I can’t point to one moment and say “this is when I fell for you.”
It was quieter than that.

It was in the small things.

In the way I started looking forward to hearing from you.
In the way your name stopped being just a name.
In the way my mood could change just by knowing you were around.

You became a part of my days without asking for space —
and somehow, without taking too much either.

That’s rare.

This year taught me something important:
real connections don’t arrive loudly.
They grow slowly, patiently, without demanding attention.

And you… you grew into my life like that.

Today, when I think about last year, I don’t think about how much has changed around us.
I think about how much has changed inside me.

I think about how you became someone I care about — deeply, genuinely, without conditions.

I think about how your happiness started mattering to me in a way I didn’t plan.

I think about how, even on days we didn’t talk much,
you still stayed somewhere in my thoughts.

That’s when I knew this wasn’t just a phase.
It wasn’t just a moment.

It was something real.

One year ago, we met.
And today, I’m grateful — not because everything is perfect,
but because something honest began.

I don’t know what the future looks like.
I won’t pretend I have answers.
But I know this:
meeting you was not a coincidence to my heart.

If I could go back to that day last year,
I wouldn’t change anything.

Not the timing.
Not the words.
Not even the silence.

Because every part of it led to this —
to me sitting here, writing to you, feeling thankful that our paths crossed.

Moni,
thank you for being exactly who you are.
Thank you for being gentle in ways you don’t even realize.
Thank you for being someone my heart feels safe choosing.

One year ago, we met.
And today, I can say this honestly —

No matter what tomorrow brings,
I’m glad it was you.

Always.
